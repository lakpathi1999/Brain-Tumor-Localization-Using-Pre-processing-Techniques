# Brain-Tumor-Localization-Using-Pre-processing-Techniques
To detect the brain tumor in early stages, Digital image processing plays an important role in the analysis of medical images. Using image processing, the tumor detection process becomes much easier.
The steps for detecting brain tumors in MRI images using medical image processing are: Acquisition of MRI image, Pre-processing, Image enhancement, image filtering, Threshoulding, image segmentation and feature extraction.
In this paper the pre-processing stage performs image filtering, The median filter is used for image enhancement .It is used to remove the noise in an image .It is better than mean filter ,wiener filter, Gaussian filter. Thresholding is used to determine the region of tumor in the image.
